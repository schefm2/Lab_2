Functions

	Port_Init
		Sets P3.0 to P3.6 as outputs
		Sets P2.0 to P2.5 as inputs
		Sets P1.1 as analog input
	End Port_Init
	
	Timer_Init
		Set Timer0 to use SYSCLK and 16 bit
		Clear Timer0
	End Timer_Init

	Interrupt_Init
		Enable global interrupts
		Enable Timer0 overflow interrupt
	End Interrupt_Init

	ADC_Init
		Set V_ref to 2.4V
		Enable ADC1 converter
		Wait while capacitors charge
		Reset timer0 and T0_overflows
		
	End ADC_Init
	
	Timer0_ISR __interrupt 1
		Increments T0_overflows
	End Timer0_ISR __interrupt 1
	
	Game_Start
		Set all outputs off
		Print instructions of game
		Wait until SS2 is flicked to start game
	End Game_Start
	
	Mode_Select
		Calculated wait_time using wait_converter
		If Competitive Mode pushbutton NOT held and slide switch is to left
			Run Bin_To_Hex
		If Competitive Mode pushbutton held and slide switch is to left
			Run Bin_To_Hex
			Store score
			Run Bin_To_Hex
			End_Game
		If Competitive Mode pushbutton held and slide switch is to right
			Run Hex_To_Bin
			Store score
			Run Hex_To_Bin
			End_Game
		If Competitive Mode pushbutton NOT held and slide switch is to right
			Run Hex_To_Bin
	End Mode_Select
	
	End_Game
		Print statement for end of competitive mode
		Compare scores of first and second player
		Print corresponding message
	End End_Game
	
	The_Seeder
		Records state of SS1
		Starts Timer0
		When SS1 is flicked, stop Timer0
		T0_overflows is used to seed rand()
		Reset Timer0
	End The_Seeder
	
	random
		return rand() % 15 for a random char 0 thru 15 inclusive
	End random
	
	read_AD_input
		Set multiplexer pin to be converted
		Clear A/D conversion bit
		Start A/D conversion
		Wait until conversion finishes
		return ADC1
	End read_AD_input
	
	Hex_To_Bin
		
	End Hex_To_Bin
	
	Bin_To_Hex
		Display brief instructions
		Zero the game score and round number
		Turn off all the LEDs and run start sequence function

		For 8 rounds
			Generate a random number from 0 to 15
			for digits in binary check if last digit is 1
				If bit 0 of the random number is 1, LED0 is lit
				If bit 1 of the random number is 1, LED1 is lit
				If bit 2 of the random number is 1, LED2 is lit
				divide number to convert by two so checking last digit is valid
			Clear the timer overflow_count value
			Wait for a keyboard press [input = getchar()]
			Save the overflow_count value
		
			convert character to int then convert ascii to decimal
			If the key matches the random number, BLED is green, otherwise it is red

			run calculate score function
			Display the points for the try and total score on the terminal

			Delay for 0.5 second
			Turn off the BLED
		End of the 8 tries loop

		Display the final score and sound the buzzer for ~0.5 second
