Binary to Hex Function
	Display brief instructions
	Zero the game score and round number
	Turn off all the LEDs and run start sequence function

	For 8 rounds
		Generate a random number from 0 to 15
		for digits in binary check if last digit is 1
			If bit 0 of the random number is 1, LED0 is lit
			If bit 1 of the random number is 1, LED1 is lit
			If bit 2 of the random number is 1, LED2 is lit
			divide number to convert by two so checking last digit is valid
		Clear the timer overflow_count value
		Wait for a keyboard press [input = getchar()]
		Save the overflow_count value
If the key matches the random number, BLED is green, otherwise it is red
Calculate the point score based on the following example:
If overflow_count > wait_time then points = 0
Otherwise points = 10 – (10 * overflow_count)/wait_time
Ex) wait_time = 1000, overflow_count = 650, points = 10 – (10 * 650)/1000 = 4
(Integer arithmetic truncates 6.5 to 6 so total is 4.)
Display the points for the try and total score on the terminal
Delay for 0.5 second
Turn off the BLED
End of the 8 tries loop
Display the final score and sound the buzzer for ~0.5 second
